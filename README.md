# The QuickSort Algorithm

This is a project I completed while taking "Stanfordx: Algorithms Design And Analysis, Part I" on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice coding up the QuickSort algorithm using different pivoting rules. Students then apply their algorithms to compute the total number of comparisons used to sort integers between 1 and 10,000 in unsorted order.

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
