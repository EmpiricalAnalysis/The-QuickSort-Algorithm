# The QuickSort Algorithm

In this project I coded up three versions of the QuickSort algorithm using different pivoting rules. I then used these algorithms to compute the total number of comparisons used to sort a list of 10,000 integers that are in unsorted order.

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
